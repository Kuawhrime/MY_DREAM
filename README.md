## Wolfenstein-Style Raycasting Engine

A recreation of the classic Wolfenstein 3D rendering technique using raycasting, implemented in C.

This project demonstrates the fundamental principles of early 3D game development and computer graphics.

## 🎮 Project Overview

This project aims to recreate the groundbreaking pseudo-3D graphics technique used in Wolfenstein 3D (1992).

Using raycasting, the engine creates a 3D perspective from a 2D map, similar to how id Software revolutionized first-person gaming.

### Key Features

- Raycasting engine built from scratch in C
- Textured walls with distance-based shading
- Player movement and rotation
- Collision detection
- Minimap display and level editor with imgui (optional)
- Performance-optimized rendering

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

- Language: C
- Graphics Library: [To be determined - e.g., SDL2, OpenGL]
- Build System: [Make, CMake if a choose to do cross-compatibility]
- Platform: linux-based, maybe Cross-platform

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

```bash
# Required dependencies will be listed here
```

### Building the Project

```bash
# Build instructions will be added
```

### Running the Game

```bash
# Execution instructions will be added
```

## 🎯 Implementation Details

The raycasting technique works by:
1. Casting rays from the player's position
2. Calculating distance to walls
3. Determining wall height based on distance
4. Rendering vertical strips to create the 3D effect

## 📝 Development Roadmap

- [ ] Basic engine setup and window creation
- [ ] Implement basic raycasting
- [ ] Add textured walls
- [ ] Implement player movement
- [ ] Add collision detection
- [ ] Optimize rendering performance
- [ ] Add minimap feature and imgui level editor
